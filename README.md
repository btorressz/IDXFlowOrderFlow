# IDXFlowOrderFlow

## üìå Overview


A modular Ethereum smart contract that rewards high-frequency traders and stakers through a composable, multi-tiered incentive system. It tracks per-user trading volume across epochs, distributes token rewards with vesting and auto-compounding options, and supports advanced features such as permit-based staking, gas rebates, NFT-bound accounts (ERC-6551), zero-knowledge proof validation, KYC compliance, and cross-chain state mirroring using LayerZero. The protocol is designed for scalable, compliant, and capital-efficient DeFi reward distribution.

This repository contains an Ethereum adaptation of the Solana-based **IDXFlow OrderFlow** smart contract(https://github.com/btorressz/idxflow_orderflow)
